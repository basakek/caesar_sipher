Caesar cipher is a really quite ancient type of encryption. When Caesar wanted to send highly sensitive military messages,he would encode his message so that each letter would be shifted by a  predetermined amount.

And this is what the final version will look like.:
I'm going to type encode to start encrypting a message. And then I'm going to type my message with no spaces in between. And then I'm going to give it a shift number.
So this is going to be a number that the recipient and I are going to agree on so that we know how to decode the message.
